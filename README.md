# How the Internet Works - Interactive Visualization

A web-based visualization project explaining the intricate workings of the Internet through an interactive and engaging interface.

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide a visual and interactive explanation of how the Internet works. Instead of traditional presentation formats, I chose to use the medium itself (a website) to explain its underlying mechanisms, creating a more immersive learning experience.

## Purpose

- Demonstrate complex networking concepts through visual representations
- Create an engaging learning experience for viewers
- Provide an interactive platform for understanding Internet technologies
- Bridge the gap between technical concepts and visual learning

## Current Status

This is the initial version of the project, and while it covers the basic concepts, there are plans for future improvements including:
- Enhanced animations and visual effects
- More interactive elements
- Expanded technical explanations

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Prof. Pranav Sahasrabudhe for providing the opportunity to work on this unique project.

## Note

While I acknowledge that this initial version may not cover all aspects comprehensively, I am committed to improving and expanding this project based on feedback and continued learning.
